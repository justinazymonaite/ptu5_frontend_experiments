    <h1>DIAMOND EDUCATION</h1>

    <h2 class="left">Diamond - Form of Carbon</h2>
    <img class="img-text1" src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/dda5OPEzVJ4jb-4i_idQtZ0zyRU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GettyImages-sb10065243q-001-58a0bfc93df78c4758015f1f.jpg">
    <p class="text1">Diamond is a solid form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a crystal structure called diamond cubic. At room temperature and pressure, another solid form of carbon known as graphite is the chemically stable form of carbon, but diamond converts to it extremely slowly. Diamond has the highest hardness and thermal conductivity of any natural material. Most natural diamonds have ages between 1 billion and 3.5 billion years. Most were formed at depths between 150 and 250 kilometres (93 and 155 mi) in the Earth's mantle, although a few have come from as deep as 800 kilometres (500 mi). Under high pressure and temperature, carbon-containing fluids dissolved various minerals and replaced them with diamonds. Much more recently (hundreds to tens of million years ago), they were carried to the surface in volcanic eruptions and deposited in igneous rocks known as kimberlites and lamproites.</p>

    <h2 class="right">Diamond Color</h2>
    <p class="text-right">Diamond Color of most gem-quality diamonds actually means lack of color. A chemically pure and structurally perfect diamond has no hue, like a drop of pure water, and consequently, a higher value.Because the arrangement of atoms in diamond is extremely rigid, few types of impurity can contaminate it (two exceptions are boron and nitrogen). Small numbers of defects or impurities color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown (defects), green (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange, or red. Naturally colored diamonds outside the normal color range are called fancy-color diamonds.</p>

    <h2 class="left">Diamond Carat Weight</h2>
    <p class="text-left">To put it simply, diamond carat weight measures how much a diamond weighs. A metric “carat” is defined as 200 milligrams. All else being equal, diamond price increases with diamond carat weight because larger diamonds are rarer and more desirable. However, two diamonds of equal carat weight can have very different values (and prices) depending on three other factors of the diamond 4Cs: Color, Clarity, and Cut. </p>

    <h2 class="right">Diamond Clarity</h2>
    <p class="text-right">Diamond clarity refers to the absence of inclusions and blemishes. Diamond creation process can result in a variety of internal characteristics called inclusions and external characteristics called blemishes. Evaluating diamond clarity involves determining the number, size, relief, nature, and position of these characteristics, as well as how these affect the overall appearance of the stone. If you are trying to determine what is the best clarity for a diamond, remember that no diamond is perfectly pure. But the closer it comes to purity, the better its clarity. </p>

    <h2 class="left">Diamond Cut</h2>
    <p class="text-left">Diamonds are renowned for their ability to transmit light and sparkle so intensely. We often think of a diamond’s cut as shape (round, heart, oval, marquise, pear), but what diamond cut actually does mean is how well a diamond’s facets interact with light. Precise artistry and workmanship are required to fashion a stone so its proportions, symmetry and polish deliver the magnificent return of light only possible in a diamond. Achieving the best cut for a diamond reflects in the stone’s final beauty and value. And of all the diamond 4Cs, it is the most complex and technically difficult to analyze.</p>

    <h2 class="h2last">Lab Grown Diamond</h2>
    <p class="textlast">Lab-grown diamonds also known as lab-created diamonds, synthetic diamonds and man-made diamonds are grown in laboratories to replicate natural diamonds which are formed in the earth's core. They do this by replicating the same chemical and optical properties as natural diamonds. There are two main ways to create a man-made diamond. There is high-pressure, high-temperature diamond (HPHT) growth which is designed to replicate the conditions of natural diamond growth. And there is chemical vapour deposition (CVD) which starts with a diamond seed and derives carbon from a vapour to grow into a diamond. Typically, it takes a few weeks for a man-made diamond to be grown in a laboratory. This is much shorter than the millions or billions of years natural diamonds take to be produced. Man-made diamond prices are generally lower than natural diamonds, and the price of lab-grown diamonds continues to drop each year. </p>
